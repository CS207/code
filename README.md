# Overview
simple Boat use Arduino ,Motor and propeller


#Setup
I will write code be run the Arduino and to build the project
the code is for control the Electric motor
I have buy a chip :　２９３　for control the direction
and I will build a RGB light for the ship.
pin 9,10,11 for the RGB LED

#Goals
use computer to control the motor change direction.

#Critique
I had buy propeller
but the hole for the propeller is too big for the motor.
so I will use paper and tape to build instead it

#code
the file "project.ino"
